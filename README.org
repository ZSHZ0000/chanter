* CHANTER

** Prelude
This is a project that should implement a programming language (very) loosely
based on lua.

Currently only the lexer works with a limited set of tokens, the roadmap is still
long.

** Building
Change directory from the root of the project to =/src/= then execute
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ make
#+END_SRC
it should build without problems as long as you have the required headers.

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ ./chanter file.chn
#+END_SRC

** Short-term To Do
- Lexer :: Possibly clean-up, make it more orthogonal(?).
- Parser :: To implement the parser with the pieces we have so far.
- Documentation :: Documentation must be provided & improved.
- Compiler :: So we can generate bytecode.
- Virtual machine :: So we can execute byttecode.
