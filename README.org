* CHANTER

** Prelude
This is a project that should implement a programming language (very) loosely
based on lua.

Currently only the lexer works with a limited set of tokens, the roadmap is still
long.

** Building
Change directory from the root of the project to =/src/= then execute
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ make
#+END_SRC
it should build without problems as long as you have the required headers.

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ ./chanter file.chn
#+END_SRC

** Short-term To Do
- Parser :: to build abstract syntax trees that the compiler will process.
- Compiler :: to process the tree, do optimizing passes & throw bytecode out.
- Virtual machine :: to be able to execute beforementioned bytecode.
