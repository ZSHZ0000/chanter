* CHANTER

** Prelude
This is a project that should implement a functional programming language
loosely alike in lua in syntax but with some more extra features that I
think lua could had enjoyed of.

Currently the prototype infrastructure is being developed in common lisp,
contributions are welcome.

** Building
No need to build it, you only need STEEL BANK COMMON LISP or GNU CLISP or
your favourite common lisp implementation.

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ ./chanter file.chn
#+END_SRC

** Short-term To Do
- Lexer :: Create a lexer in common lisp.
- Parser :: Create a parser in common lisp.
- CPS Transformer :: Create CPS Transformer in common lisp.
- Documentation :: Documentation must be provided & improved.
- Compiler :: So we can generate lisp assembler instructions.
- Assembler :: Probably will need peephole optimiser on it.
- Virtual machine :: It's instruction set must be further developed.
